2014 School project - 3D engine
===============================

# Mission
We had to make a project of our own using C and the SDL library. I chose to
implement a 3D engine. To do that I used raytracing method. 

It is unoptimized, every calculus is made on the CPU, single threaded but it
allowed me to implement a 3D engine from scratch, using only the SDL to color
pixel on the screen.
