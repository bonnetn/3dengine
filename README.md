2014 School project - 3D engine
===============================

## Mission
We had to make a project of our own using C and the SDL library. I chose to
implement a 3D engine. To do that I used raytracing method. 

It is unoptimized, every calculus is made on the CPU, single threaded but it
allowed me to implement a 3D engine from scratch. I redid all the math, and I 
only used the SDL library tocolor the pixels on the screen.
